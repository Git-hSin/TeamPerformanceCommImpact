# TeamPerformanceCommImpact

How do different sports teams performances impact the communities that surround the cities they are in?


## Introduction

Sports teams in a city provide historic data in various categories related to those teams performances over time. The impact of those performances can be measured alongside datasets of: the economies and demographics; of the communities that surround them, during that same period. 

## Hypothesis

A team's performance will benefit economies of production and real estate, in the communities that surround them, and affect demographic groups differently across those sets. 

## Sources & Method

Independent variables, primary of which is time, studied across all datasets are consistent in these categories:
- Geographic location & the demographics within
  - Income, real estate value, ethnicity, 
  
- Sport Organizations
